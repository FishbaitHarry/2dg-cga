Card Game Assistant

The purpose of this project is to create the most stupidly simple application for a very specific purpose: tracking life points in collectible and non-collectible card games. As a bonus, it might support tracking any kind of points in any kind of traditional tabletop game.

This project has been started because other applications available for this purpose are either ugly, bloated or unwieldy, or I just didn't spend enough time researching them. Have fun!
